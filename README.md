# pathfinder-1e-char-sheet
A simple webapp version of the character sheet for the Pathfinder Role-Playing Game. 

A Pathfinder character sheet has a few dozen moving components the player must keep track of at all times. Five different components go into determining how effectively a character can attack, for example. 

The number of variables to keep track of on a paper sheet becomes apparent whenever players suffer certain "conditions" which temporarily modify their values. The goal of this project is to create a dynamic sheet which changes all related values whenever a value is modified, simplifying character management.
